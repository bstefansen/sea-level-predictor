## Why
I built this project to better understand Python's data science packages and utilize different modules like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Features
- Users can upload books to the application
- Users can see books created by the same author after clicking on a book

## Installation
- UNDER CONSTRUCTION

### Development

For development, you can use `main.py` to test your functions.

### Data Source
