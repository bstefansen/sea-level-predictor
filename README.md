# Sea Level Predictor

A Python script used to calculate future predictions for sea level change through the year 2050 using linear regression.

## Why
I built this project to better understand Python's data science packages and utilize different modules like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Features
- Users can calculate data plots after running the program
- Users can predict further into the future if necessary and change the dataset

## Installation
- UNDER CONSTRUCTION

### Development

For development, you can use `main.py` to test your functions. The calculations rest in `sea_level_predictor.py`

### Data Source
Global Average Absolute Sea Level Change, 1880-2014 from the US Environmental Protection Agency using data from CSIRO, 2015; NOAA, 2015.
